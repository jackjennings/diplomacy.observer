				1901 Spring — The Nervous New Year

The entrance of the twentieth century has opened the door for a specter of discontent. In Europe, the ongoing triumphs of engineering and industry have grown apace and buoyed the political weight of the great powers; they eye their large neighbors in a race of political and military might, and leer at the at the nearby domains previously unconquerable. Maybe because of the the season or maybe the year, the metallic taste of conquest seems palatable to Europeans leaders in 1901.

The Austro-Hungarian and Turkish forces begin dividing the Balkans between themselves. Britain, Russia and Germany also push North, unsurprisingly, into once-neutral Scandinavia.

Perhaps anticipating another Northern push — the Italian armies garrisoned in Venice and Rome mobilizing into the Alps — the Dual Monarchy maintains their defensive stance in Trieste and Vienna.

The West sees the first spark of conflict, as France and Germany collide in Burgundy. Only to keen observers is it clear which is the aggressor and which the aggressed. Having maintained their sovereign border, the rest of the French military presses Eastward, unopposed.

In all, a cautious Spring ———

				1901 Fall — On Tiptoes Marching

A cautious Spring gives way to a hesitant autumn, as the European powers do their best as to avoid undue conflict.

In the North, Britain and Russia settle into their frigid fortifications, cleanly dividing the resources of Scandinavia with Germany. In the Low Countries as well, Britain and Germany coordinate their movements such that their presence is not seen, only known through the messages tapped through telegram wires.

France — confident after their skirmish in Burgundy — sweep into Iberia.

Eastward: Turkish and Russian forces set up parallel lines, Rumania and the Black Sea forming a no-mans-land between the two Empires. Continued aggression may balloon into a battle — for now, waiting for the other to blink.

Austria-Hungary’s conquest of Serbia has satisfied the crown, whose attention is diverted by the Italian forces on the horizon. In a show of defensive power, the armies in Vienna and Serbia form an impenetrable line around the port of Trieste.

The Italians, seemingly uninterested in their heavily garrisoned neighbor, pin the German army in Munich — though the make no headway there. In a surprising move, The Italian fleet sails into Greece successfully; if they had expected aid the admirals do not need it.

				1902 Spring — The Alpine Accord

After a difficult winter, the armies of Europe now move with renewed purpose.

Their delegates having seemingly found an agreement to disarm a budding conflict, the German, Italian, and Austro-Hungarian armies have disengaged their counterparts around Tyrolia.

The British, having doubled the size of their navy, press their advantage by securing the English Channel, while the French maintain their fleets stationed along the Eastern coastline.

Germany makes an unsuccessful bid for Belgium, but—seeing an indefensible position in Burgundy—brazenly marches across the French border. Possibly in anticipating this aggression, French armies have begun returning from their Iberian expedition.

In the South, a joint movement between Russia and Austria-Hungary topples an attempt by Turkey to capture Rumania, with Russian forces seizing control of the country.

Quizzically, the Italian occupation of Greece is short lived, as the fleet moored in Athens takes back to the sea in conjunction with an overall Eastward military thrust.

The Northern fortifications remain frozen.
			</div>

1902 Fall — The Enemy Closer

Plans born of the Spring continue in the Fall — some bearing fruit and others withering on the vine.

Britain's pressure campaign against the French begins in force, the Western armada pinning the French navy in their positions.

Behind their naval blockade, the French army marches back into Paris and Marseilles, fending off an opportunistic Italian attempt to capture the latter.

With accolades due to the German spy network, a British attack on Holland is deftly countered to a stalemate, while the remaining Germany military divisions begin massing to eject the continental Brits.

In more bad news for the British, Russian joint operations surprise the fleet moored in Trondheim; the British sailors abandon Norway with no shots fired.

Continuing their cooperation, the Russian occupying force in Rumania now lends a hand to the Austro-Hungarian push into Bulgaria — the Turkish army is routed, and an advancing regiment from Constantinople is prevented from entering.

In the Mediterranean, Italy has second thoughts about abandoning their outpost in Greece, and simultaneously establishes another in Tunisia.
			</div>

			<div class="season">
1903 Spring — Enemy Waters

The conflict in Europe continues to focus on naval superiority. 

In the North, Britain trades its holdings in St. Petersburg for control of Russian Norway — the latter evacuated by the Russians perceptibly anticipating a counterattack.

In the Low Countries, the King's Army is not as lucky, for though the British force in Belgium had dug in with protection from the sea, the Germans pressed their attack again. With the French army advancing to the countryside, any British troops that were not captured found their way across the channel with assistance from Belgian partisans.

Fleets patrolling the Mediterranean circled each other as each made aggressive maneuvers. Reports from both the French and Italian port cities claimed sightings of other, sparking some worry about an escalation in the dispute at the border.

Italian and Austrian fleets moved in concert toward the Turks, who are seeming to struggle in rallying neighboring powers to their defense.

1903 Fall — With Overwhelming Force

Firm alliances are not a part of this new sort of European conflict. Where there once may have be a familial bond between dynasties, in this modern world anyone can hold their nose and stand alongside a once-unthinkable ally—even to the detriment of the state—all in the name of power.

As such, the peace between the Russians and Austrians has not withstood the temptation of expansion; the Austro-Hungarian army levels all of it’s might against Rumania, which falls to their advance. A valiant show of support from the army in the Ukraine gives cover to their retreat.

The Russian themselves, fed up with the British meddling, oust the marauding fleet from Norway — the previous victory in reclaiming St. Petersburg rolling effortlessly through the Norwegian highlands; the Russian morale is undaunted by shelling from the offshore British fleet.

The Ottoman’s perplexing strategy seems to be opening the doors for the Austrians — in fact, offering a royal escort — though the Austrians clearly misinterpret this gesture as an opportunity to instead push the Italian fleet into Smyrna.

At home, the Italians have issues of their own, as the French fleets seen offshore make a beeline for Naples, executing a flawless offensive against the undefended port city. Italian fleets elsewhere reconcile their positions to begin a counteroffensive.

In the South of France, an exploratory Italo-Germanic probe on the defenses of Marseilles is halted at the border, as the Italian army gets word that their support coming from Burgundy is tied up in a skirmish with the Parisian army.

Britain, dealt a blow in the Spring, shores up their hold of the Atlantic with a powerful move into the Mid-Atlantic — potentially becoming a gatekeeper to France in the Mediterranean.
			</div>

				1904 Spring — The Day Europe Stood Still

Though it took three years of preliminary maneuvering, hostilities in Europe have devolved into outright war — just in time for no one to make much progress at all.

The mess in the north gets messier as Germany attempts to expand their holding into Sweden. Despite this attack, Russian generals in Norway double back back to St. Petersburg, while the Swedish and Finish contingencies deftly fend off both the challenge from the British and Germany militaries.

The French, while on the back-foot, also hold a majority of their holdings against a three enemies — only ceding Brest to the English Navy in the West. The German attack on Paris is disrupted by a sneak attack into Burgundy, flanking the secondary German regiment just as it mobilized Westward. The Marseillais quickly march home blunting the Italian pressure at the border.

Unsurprisingly, the Italians have more luck pushing the French out of their occupation of Naples; the French admiralty wastes no time in sending reinforcements to batter the coastline of the struggling Italians.

The Austrians continue to make methodical progress in the East, guaranteeing a foothold in Galicia along a sparsely populated Southern front with Russia — despite an effort by Russia for the same.

Turkey, begrudgingly accepting Italian occupation of Smyrna, attempts a Northern-ward grab as well, but is blocked in both avenues by the fleet in Sevastopol.
			</div>

			<div class="season">
				1904 Fall — The Offensive Defensive

The shift of power among nations is becoming tipped — irreparably?

French and Turkish forces continue to face insurmountable odds. Valiant attempts by French forces to take Brest and Tunis falter under decisive counterattacks, while Paris finally falls to the concerted German effort. Meanwhile — seeing the French distracted — the British make an opportunistic grab into the Iberian peninsula, seizing Portugal.

While Turkey finds a prize in finally sailing into the Black Sea, while at the same time offering aid to the Austro-Hungarian effort, find the Western border eroded by none other than the Austrians.

The Italian’s manage to reclaim Naples, but fail to make much headway elsewhere.

The Austrians are on the move: not satisfied with wresting Rumania from Russia, the Dual Monarchy enlists (coerces?) the help of Turkey to claim Sevastopol in a major blow to Russian naval activity; as the Austro-Hungarian army enters the city, the Russia fleet is dismantled and sunk in order to prevent any war material from entering enemy hands. In the South, the Italian outpost in Greece changes hands more quietly — unable to muster any resistance to the surprise advance, the Italian civilian corp can only abandon their positions and return home.

In colder climates, Russia finds better luck. Again keeping out the British from Scandinavia, St. Petersburg also comes back under Russian control, cementing the defensive line that had been until now particularly fluid.

1905 Spring — Silent Alarm

The citizens of Europe are worried; the news presses in every nation sound the klaxon of a growing menace; the governments of Europe: silent.

Throughout the early months, the day's headlines across the continent speak only of the stunning—though perhaps unsurprising—advance of the Austrian army. Seemingly unsatisfied with their Eastern expansion, the Monarchy looks North to Warsaw and West to Venice, easily taking control of both. The success of the Austro-Hungarian campaign seems to have united the populace of the dual nation, finding a deep well of eager recruits.

Once-influential Turkish and French governments collapse, falling into civil disarray as their militaries fail to stall the incursion into the core of their respective homelands.

The Italians find a respite from French aggression, only to be replaced by a new Eastern front with the Austrians — an unexpected attack without any viable nearby defense.

Germany, continuing to advance their occupation of the entire Northern continental coastline, eject the British from Brest — at the same moment the English fleet launches from London into the Channel.

While Russians in the South valiantly try to stop the Austrian advance, the Northern contingent cheers as the British Navy retreats from the Barents Sea.

1905 Fall — The Seat of Power

Mass protests in Turkey have culminated in the overthrow of the Austrophile monarchy; a military coup has installed a functional government and quelled dissent just in time to halt the Austro-Hungarian landing in Ankara.

The French republic is not so lucky, with a coordinated attack by Italian forces in Marseille bringing and end to the republican experiment.

Britain and Germany continue their feud, successfully tying up each others forces in skirmishes along the coast.

Austrian forces in Venice, finding no resistance from the Italians, march with bravado into the capital — with Italian forces occupied in distant conflicts, Rome falls in a day. Further angering the Italians, an occupying force shipped from Tunis is rebuffed in Athens; roundly defeated, they return over seas to ensure at least their Tunisian outpost is secure.

In the East, another capital succumbs to the Austro-Hungarian thirst for conquest: while the Prussian contingency keeps Russian-occupied Warsaw at bay, a concentrated effort from the South can’t be stopped by Russia’s Moscow regiment. Editorials in the European press wonder: is there an outer limit to Austrian expansion?
			</div>

			<div class="season">
				1906 Spring — Blinders

After the public outcry in 1905, governments are taking heed to the Austrian onslaught, but — for better or worse — international reactions are extremely varied: some stand and fight, some become complicit, others turn a blind eye.

Italy and Turkey reposition in an attempt to hold the south. With Ankara back under Turkish control, the Italian occupying force sets sail towards home. Realizing the Venice is indefensible — Italian armies set up defensive positions in an attempt to liberate besieged cities. The Tunisian contingency is finally recalled to the peninsula, it’s members rabid with anti-Austrian sentiment.

In the North, Britain sees the ascendent Austrians as a means to finally break through the Russian wall. While the Russians expected Norway to remain the target of British military strategy, the formations of an opportunistic Anglo-Austrian alliance means St. Petersburg once again comes under control of the crown.

German forces for the most part eye the naval invaders with indifference; seemingly satisfied in their territorial ambitions, a strong defensive position and coastal patrol effortlessly prevent raiding parties from making any headway on the continent.
			</div>

			<div class="season">
				1906 Fall — Reach

Austrian war news has begun to be reported as so the weather. Incursions into Rome and Ankara are seen as all but inevitable; life in these cities goes on as well as it can, with Austro-Hungarian troops march on the capital steps. The piecemeal resistance from scattered armies is secretly heralded by the populace, but outwardly the attitude is somber.

In the West, the British belligerence has pushed the Germans and Russian generals to eye cooperation. Rather than contest their fickle hold of St. Petersburg, the Russian naval officers in Norway and the Germans in Holland push out the British from their hold of the North Sea, ending a frustrating blockade that had bottled both navies for years.

Clearly taken by surprise, the British fleets off the Iberian coast sail away from the action into the Mediterranean, to the chagrin of the Italians — and likely worrying the prospects of the meagre Austro-Hungarian naval corps.

German troops in France march Eastward, finally getting orders from above to shore up the defensive line against the encroaching power of the Dual Monarchy. Accolades to the Kaiser flood the German press, and wash away the indecision of 1905.

				Posted this year 1906 to all European states from the Austro-Hungarian Crown:

				*AUSTRIAE EST IMPERARE ORBI UNIVERSO*

DECLARATION OF AUSTRO-HUNGARIAN WORLD DOMINATION BY THE GRACE OF GOD!

Wonderful news, fellow Christians and dearest friends!

The Dual Monarchy has completed her Most Sacred Crusade against the Mohammedan heathens, ending the vile abomination that was the Ottoman kakistocracy and re-consecrating the Hagia Sophia after half a millenium of wicked pagan misuse!

The Archduke – now styling himself “Most August Emperor of the Resurrected Byzantine Imperium,” on top of all previous titles – wishes no further bloodshed amongst Christians, and therefore extends the following most magnanimous and merciful offer to his dear friends across Europe and beyond:

Surrender to his might… Or die.

Bend your knees, lay down your arms, spare Europe another couple of years or more of grinding steam-powered warfare, and accept and rejoice in the inevitable (because divinely ordained) outcome: AUSTRO-HUNGARIAN VICTORY!

*AUSTRIAE EST IMPERARE ORBI UNIVERSO*

				1907 Spring — Mutineers and Deserters

Though credit is due to the fortitude and dedication of the Russian military, their dedication to a faltering cause could only last so long. With another Winter coming under full occupation, and long-shot odds getting longer, the Russian enlisted ranks reject the plans of their senior officers and refuse to go on. Though the last Russia fleet in the North Sea manages to evade attacks from the British and Germans (who find themselves in a tangle instead), the army encamped in Norway dissolves under pressure.

In the South, the Austrian assault is finally blunted. Anticipating a retreat from besieged Rome, a counterattack into Piedmont routs the Austrians — their surprised regiments leaving behind artillery, ammo, and supplies as they flee. The morale of the disillusioned Italians is bolstered slightly, even as their abandoned overseas outposts fall into enemy hands.

Germany — still wavering in their commitment to a full attack on one front — makes progress towards the Iberian peninsula, looking towards Spain and Marseilles. Though their generals being entrenching on the Eastern boarder with the former-Russian Empire, the smoke on the horizon appears distinctly Austrian.

				1907 Fall — A Declaration Unheeded

				The Austro-Hungarian proclamation of 1907 — the so-called Manifesto Orbi Universo — is met with a deadening silence from the remaining European leaders. Whether by naivety, hope, or fatalism: unclear. The inner circle of the Kaiser have not been seen publicly in months; Italian ministers are more or less in hiding, sending communication through secret channels; the British admiralty more or less comprises a de facto government at sea.

But in war, denial should be left for the dead. The Austrians march on.

Berlin falls catastrophically — the seat of government evacuated to Kiel, lead out of the capital by the Kaiser himself. Though occupation of France is complete, the morale of the German navy sinks along with the prospects of ever unmooring from the Low Countries.

The momentum of recapturing Rome does not carry the Italian fortunes back into Venice. The Dual Monarchy has erected a defense in the North seemingly impenetrable to the supply-starved Italian army.

The British fail to expand their hold on Scandinavia, but manage to bottle the far-flung German army in Sweden; a force now despairingly distant from their besieged homeland.
			</div>

			<div class="season">
				1908 Spring — Westerreich

				Cities and towns along the warfront running from Berlin to Rome have abandoned their homes; an Austrian army unfathomably large seems to advance with disregard to fortifications and entrenchments — though its monstrous surface make some setbacks inevitable.

Germany musters all of their remaining forces in Munich to recapture the seat of government, but in doing so must cede Munich to a Southwardly attacking Austro-Hungarian contingent. Separatist partisans in Southern Germany — many wonder if the fist of Austrian occupation might smash the unification of the Germanies.

While fortunes are poor in the East, the Germans do keep the British at bay — though the overdue dissolution of the Independent Russian Naval Corp (НРВК) allows a newly bolstered British Navy to finally reform the blocked of the North Sea. In the Scandinavian countries, a seasoned German army manages to repel the British — holding key positions along the coastline.

For some reason — perhaps by fault of an overambitious admiral — the British fleet in Spain sets sail for Marseilles; a feat that by no stretch of the imagination could be accomplished before Summer. Even before the fleet can round the Iberian peninsula, the German army plows across the border, leaving the naval force bewildered and quite adrift.

Finally, the remaining Italian officer corp, largely comprised of Roman recruits too young and too old, manages to walk into occupied Venice without (mercifully) firing a single shot. The Austrians instead sidestep their advance — setting up positions just outside the remaining Italian strongholds.
			</div>

			<div class="season">
				1908 Fall — Empire out of the East

After eight years of war, the first great conflict of the 20th century draws to a close — the dual seats of Vienna and Budapest now govern more than half of continental Europe, and with it the fates of the former European dynasties.

Feigning interest in toppling Germany and Italy, the Austrians have instead made diversionary grabs at undefended British outposts, bringing Austro-Hungarian influence and resources well beyond what may be challenged by any European coalition.

Even so, the British remain the dominant naval power, even as their holdings erode on the continent. A single fleet props up the Italian government — now controlling only half of the Apennine Peninsula — while a blockade of the mediterranean is set up to ensure that the British Isles remain outside of Austrian influence, for the moment.

With Munich and Berlin in the hands of the enemy, the Germans are forced to sue for peace; hopefully the Dual Monarchy is willing to release the besieged capital in exchange for transforming the former French territories into a vassal of the new Austrian Empire.

—

Sadly, though the Austro-Hungarian effort was ascendent for years, no coalition emerged. Bickering between Britain and Germany prevented a proper defense in the East, even as Italy and Russia rang loudly the warning bells. Get powers were willing to extend the olive branch and make lasting bonds with their neighbors — a weakness that allowed the Austrians to sail to newfound European dominance.
