				1901 Spring — Assassination and Mobilization

				It was as though the catastrophic events of 1901 were predetermined.

As 1899 rolled into 1900, the new century had roared to life with renewed national fervor. The previous decades of unification efforts having cemented into a new set of national identities, and an eagerness to demonstrate the conviction of the whole being.

Paternalistic leaders throughout Europe saw an opportunity to re-claim the rights of foggy empires: putting engineers to work on massive infrastructure projects and redoubling production of ammunition for bizarre war machines; swelling the ranks of the enlisted and employing every dry-dock towards bolstering the naval fleet. By the end of the new year 1900, everyone quite wondered just what all these soldiers ought to now do. Only left wondering — that is — until the muscular nationalism of empire inevitably weighs too heavily on the desperate nationalism of the suppressed.

For in Russian Poland, in the port city of Gdańsk, the bomb went off not a moment too late — predetermined.

On that Spring day, the motorcade of Governor-General Mikhail Chertkov carried the namiestnik briskly to his next engagement: a meeting with the harbourmaster over some issue with tarif discrepancies; now stopped by some kind of commotion just ahead. Now no more namiestnik.

In the days that followed, rumors of a plot by Polish republicans —— or was it Prussian anarchists? Basques in exile? In Gdańsk under martial law no one quite knew by whom, or for what reason. In the rest of Europe, everyone knew the reason: for war.

Without any hesitation, British fleets litter the North Sea, seemingly charting towards the coasts of Sweden–Norway, while the emboldened French fleet disembarks Brest to wrest control of the English Channel.

The German admirals, also seeking to exercise newly commissioned warships, launch their own Scandinavian expeditions. The Danes reluctantly welcome occupation, if only in preference to the reported Russian mobilization to the East.

Meanwhile, army corps race to the frontiers. The Austro-Hungarians and the Ottomans begin a harsh military occupation to convert the Balkans nations into satellite states. A more cautious Russia sends troops to reinforce their southern command in Sevastopol. France and Germany look towards the Low Countries for a quick economic boon — potentially opening up recently-healed wounds.

Only the Italian war ministers look towards the interior — perhaps as a defensive posture against their stronger neighbors — moving both army contingents Northward to the high ground in Tyrol.

The nations of Europe, on the move.

				1901 Fall — (Throwing) Caution (to the Wind)

				As a boiling summer turns into a biting frost, the Autumn of 1901 brings a reconsideration for many European powers as continental conflict quickly turns the cannon to face its wielder. The assassination of that Russian governor is overshadowed by real or perceived aggressions, with half of the combatants pushing their questionable advantage, and the other half questioning the stability of their position.

England and Austria, seeing forces building on their border, reverse course. Regiments that had just departed in the months before return to London and Liverpool; though the apparently expected attack on the Isle doesn't materialize. Meanwhile, the Northern Royal Fleet turns to face the aggressive French, rounding Scotland to patrol the Western waterways.

Austria's contingency in Trieste walks back into Vienna to protect the capital, just missing the Italian joint force siege of the port. The remaining Austro-Hungarian forces turn to defend Trieste, having anticipated the obvious attack, but overly heavy shelling by the fleet out of Albania prevents anyone from re-entering the city.

France and Germany take advantage of the time lost to Britains change of strategy, tidily splitting the Low Countries between them. The German fleet, seeing the British receding from the North Sea, is all too eager to replace them.

Just as well, the Ottomans take this moment to expand their control across the Aegean Sea, finding no resistance to their advance brigade in Greece.

Russia finds the best fortunes — the emperor annexing all of Sweden–Norway in a sweeping maneuver from the North, while also expanding to the Austrian and Turkish borders with a quick unopposed strike into Rumania.

				1902 Spring — Слоношка

				Under orders of Nicholas II, a massive conscription decree doubles the size of the Russian army — news that is not quieted by the emperor. The news of the new garrisons in all of the major Russian cities breaks in all of the European newspapers.

Officially, the buildup is a continued crackdown on dissidents in the West, but as soon as the Russian youth are called to arms they are sent not West, but South — towards the Balkans and a budding conflict over the Rumanian outpost. Both the Turkish and Russian forces arrayed at the border appear to look towards Serbia — where Austrian aid fails to materialize for either force.

Instead, the Austro-Hungarian force pushes further South. The Ottomans in Greece are taken by surprise, and while the majority of the army in Athens bolsters the Bulgarian occupation, the rump of the army left to hold the city is captured by the overwhelming Austrian attack.

In a turn of luck considering this Greek gambit, the Italian forces peering into Trieste receive new orders: Head West! While a contingency remains to keep the Austrian's at bay, a green Hungarian regiment from Budapest manages to re-enter the port city without issue.

Anti-British sentiment in France continues to box in a flustered Royal Navy; his majesty's efforts to disembark the island stronghold thwarted, George V's enlisted men still casually parry attempts by both Germany and France's attempts to land armies on British beaches.

				1902 Fall — Eye for an Eye

The emperor of Russia continues to broadcast assurance to remain in the East: the threat of an uprising is our concern — no need to expand the Russian sphere of influence — reached out natural boundaries …

Eager to believe this to be true, the powers of the west turn viscously towards each other, allies turning against each other.

In Belgium, French forces disembark towards London, but only make it half-way across the channel before short-wave transmissions recall the transports — as Germans are reported crossing the border from Holland. Though the French command is able to establish a beachhead in Dunkirk, the Germans having already established control of key locations force the French to skirt the boarder before retreating into Burgundy. In response, the French launch a counterattack with the aid of a sympathetic Italian general, themselves taking the German garrison in Munich by surprise and capturing the southern province.

Oddly, other Italian regiments seem less inclined to assist the French, making stabs into French-controlled Spain and Marseilles — though these uncoordinated attempts withdraw quickly at the first signs of resistance.

The British look with relief at the conflict on the continent, and take the season to re-establish a defensive position along the North Sea.

In the East, an Austrian command that seems eager to placate their Russian neighbors, lends an overwhelming support to a Russian assault on Bulgaria; the Ottomans are pushed back into the territory controlled at the outset of the conflict.

				1903 Spring — The Great Swarm

				After a quiet Winter, the East has come back to life — as the Russians make an aggressive sift Westward.

With Russian troops now stationed along the boarder, German diplomats attempt to persuade their Russian counterparts to eject the unruly French — "look at the gall of them, marching into Munich and now into Berlin. Soon they'll wanting to annex Poland themselves!"

The French themselves, not content with their gains across the Alsatian border, re-open their British theater — this time successfully anchoring off the coast of Wales. As the French seek new points of conflict, they are given a third at the Italians press again on Spain. The Italians are rewarded in their persistence as French army corp in Iberia instead takes a defensive posture in Marseilles.

Sadly for the Italians, the Eastern theater fairs much worse. An apparent joint strategy with the Austro-Hungarian command falters as the naval attack expected out of Greece instead steams in the opposite direction — straight towards the Italian peninsula! In a coordinated strike, the Austrian army presses into Tyrolia and Venice, with the latter city holding out briefly before surrendering to the surprise attack.

Though the Italo-Austrian attack against Russia would have been welcome new for the besieged Ottomans, the combined Turkish forces succeed in setting up a defensive line inside the original borders of the Empire — though the Black Sea is ceded to the now redoubled Russian Southern Naval Command.

				1903 Fall — A Bit of Soil

				The short and easy war predicted by the politicians of 1901 seem a distant farce as 1903 comes to a close. In the course of three years, allies have become enemies and then united as allies again.

The West — the caustic relationship between France and Germany is most emblematic. In the North Sea rumors surround a French movement as an attempt in coordination with the Germans to push the British once again back — though they are blocked at the mouth of the channel before this can be confirmed. Meanwhile, the German army in Kiel strikes a deal with the Russians to recapture Berlin. The marauding French army in Berlin is flanked and — after heavy casualties and no possible retreat — the remaining force surrenders to the German generals.

Though the Russian force extends their favor to the Germans momentarily, the advance regiment stationed in Silesia is shortly joined by a new garrison in Prussia and Warsaw — a worrying detail that the cynical German press doesn't fail to note.

In even poorer news for the French, the souther defense falters as the Italian fleet catch the retreating Marseillais at the same moment that the Italian army storms the border. Again flanked, the French are pushed back to the interior.

The East — the neighboring Italian and Austro-Hungarian monarchies become enmeshed in conflict. The enemy army occupying Venice makes for the more lucrative prize of Rome, while the Austrian fleets make landfall in the Southern tip of the peninsula. Meanwhile, the Italian mountain stronghold decamps to move onto Trieste — setting ablaze the Austrian naval yards as the city is sacked.

The Turkish forces again muster a strong defense against the relentless Russian invasion. But unlike the previous months, the political reality of an ascendant Austria finds the sparsely defended Russian holdings in Bulgaria re-appropriated by the Austro-Hungarian generals that only recently had aided in their capture.

				1904 Spring — Trading Spaces

				In much of Europe, the grease of 20th century war has become rancid. Beleaguered conflicts remain beleaguered, while territories gained in the years prior are handed back to their original holders.

The German army reasserts control of Munich while the French regroup from the Italian offensive of 1903. The British continue to hold their defensive line. The weight of Russia remains unchallenged in Congress Poland.

All to be said that the talk of Europe is focused on the conflict between the Italians and the Dual Monarchy; the two powers who continue to trade their territories like cards: Venice is besieged, but so too falls Greece. Trieste is handed back to the Austrians, as Italian regiments are recalled to the defense of the homeland. Though the Italians remain on the back foot, they continue to frustrate the Austrian force with unexpected maneuvers.

The Turks as well manage to outmaneuver their aggressors. The army stationed in Constantinople managing to use their natural defensive position to hold the Austrians back until reinforcements arrive from the South — even as the Russians lend opportunistic support from the Black Sea.

					The dance of war has heretofore stepped erratically, but now lurches in lockstep as frustrated leaders high step across the frontiers.

Russian armies that the Austrian public had hoped were arriving as a defensive bulwark  are suddenly in their midst. A swift siege of Budapest and Vienna is followed by the arrest of the national assembly and the institution of  military curfew.

Though the Dual Monarchy is dealt a significant setback, the Italians fare worse against the Austro-Hungarians on the peninsula. Though all Italian regiments were ordered for a hail mary attack to reclaim Venice, a bloody skirmish at the edges of the city, and a flanking counterattack from the Northern Hungarian regiment sends the last Italian stronghold into enemy hands.

The English and Germans, successfully regrouping from an ascendant French attack in the years prior, independently wage successful campaigns. The Germans by land push into Bugundy, while the British fleets finally find their way back into the English channel — cutting through the French even as they attempt to exit.

The Turkish defensive position explodes into Bulgaria to wrest the Balkan territory from the Austrians, but finally falter against the Russians in the East.

					1905 Spring — Landfall

					The animosity held by the British public towards the French in 1904 was by no means reserved. Having been sequestered by an effective naval blockade for years, during a war that lasted longer than expected — exotic imports from abroad had suffered, and it was all too much for the people to bear. So, when general elections were held the Conservative party won landslide parliamentary seats running an anti-French, pro-war platform.

With a clear mandate, the new government has set aside both the old defensive posture and distrust of the Germans to finally make headway on the continent; an immense Anglo-German naval flotilla delivers the entirety of the English army to a beachhead in Dunkirk.

This coordination must worry the French, especially so as the Germans continue to capture towns out in countryside. As the contingent in Picardy returns to defend Paris, the Marseillais army heads off a second German force before they cross the border. Unhelpfully, the marauding German army evades engagement and slips deeper behind French lines.

The Eastern conflict remains chaotic. Armies skirmish everywhere, the only victories coming from Russian forces that overwhelm by sheer numbers. Notably, the Austrian port city falls from an overland attack.

Only the Turks in Constantinople are able to repel Russian sailors attempting to enter the Bosphorus Strait — launching a broad attack from both sides of waterway that cripples several of the attacking vessels.

					1905 Fall — Romantic Implosion

					Though both the French and Italian positions in the war appeared strong, by the end of 1905 both states have become swarmed with foreign fighters.

The newly emboldened British quickly expand their foothold in Dunkirk into a full-fledged occupation of Brest — finding no resistance as the whole of the English army advanced in coordination with an effortless blockade; both actions in coordination with scattered German brigades which locked down any challenge from the Paris garrison. Further German forces manage to cross the border at Alsace, leaving Paris relatively lightly defended against an array of belligerents.

With the Italian government completely under the control of the Austrians, the few remaining units make a final attack on any holdings that might prop up a quickly collapsing kingdom. Another attack into Athens appears to succeed — upon arrival finding the city deserted — but as the sailors are establishing their fortifications, a retreating Hungarian army corps soundly ejects the clearly fatigued Italians. On the peninsula, a too-familiar scene unfolds in Venice, as a siege on the city keeps Austria reinforcements from arriving but fails to capture key defensive positions. Without a clear course of action, a majority of the Italian rank and file desert their command, hoping to weather the war in hopes that peacetime will be more fruitful.

Meanwhile, the Russian Empire continues its Westward expansion — Austria occupied; Turkey again on the defensive; and Britain now facing a new threat in the North.

					1907 Spring — The Crumbling Bulwark

					The stresses of prolonged war is shown visibly in the inability of governments to maintain enthusiasm among the people, and in turn the inability to govern a populace in growing unrest.

For Turkey and Austria, the defeats of 1906 were devastating politically.

With half of the country occupied by the Russian navy, the city of Smyrna descended into a general riot against — the remaining army regiments doing all they could to prevent mass looting and the halt of all industrial production.

In an even more desire position, the government in exile of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy send an official declaration of surrender, signing extremely unfavorable terms with the Russians with the promise of limited reprisals and the release of thousands of prisoners of war.

France and Britain continue their defensive collaboration against the Russo-German attacks, with the British taking the brunt of the assault.

Without resistance, Russian forces firm up control in the Balkans, the former Italian kingdom, and even landing a small force in Edinburgh.
