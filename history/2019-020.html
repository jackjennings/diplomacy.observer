				1901 Spring — Stumbling Sabotage

				Since ceding the territory to the Prussians in 1871, Elsaß-Lothringen (née Alsace-Lorraine) existed in a dubious legal status; formerly French but not wholly German. Now at the turn of the century, many Alsatians still remembered the French rule — and these certainly far more vocal than the dwindling few who still felt any familial bonds of the former German principalities bordering the eastern side of the Rhine.

Thus: when the local elections recalled the conservative Reichstag delegates — and in their place sent members of the SDP and French-nationalist sympathizers — Berlin became nervous. The autonomy of Elsaß-Lothringen had sustained the output of lucrative industrial production centers, but talk of independence… too great a risk to maintain the precarious status quo. Troops garrisoned in Munich were quietly reassigned to the frontier.

Of course, the movement of armies never goes unnoticed, and the rumors of a German expedition with unknown goals blew quickly across to the French border towns. Fearing the worst, a night watch is taken up by the populace — which alleviated some fears as the German troops appeared to be doing nothing but sampling the regional wines.

It wasn't clear where the first shot was fired — either a young French guard far beyond his station, or a bored German recruit — but the response from the eager German generals was swift. Overnight the force sent to maintain Alsace was now the force sent to tame a Francophile uprising — with that mandate establishing control over a swath of Eastern France.

French forces in Marseille — the closest army that could quell the skirmish — instead breach the boarder into the Aosta Valley, apparently acting on faulty information.

An Italian fleet sent as an exploratory force into North Africa now looks warily at the now-vacant port of Marseilles — fair prospects in retaliation to the French affront.

Elsewhere in Europe, Turkey and Austria take stock of the Balkans — seeing the budding conflict elsewhere at a prime motivation to reassert control over the minor states therein. Similarly, Britain and Russia eye the independent states of Scandinavia as potential points of expansion to their influence on the continent.

Russia attempts to expand the Polish partition into the crown land of Galicia — though a quick parry by the Austrian troops stationed adjacent repels the intrusion.

					1901 Spring — Prosperity & Equality

For the greater part of the Spring and into Autumn, French and German delegates met in neutral Belgium, looking for any accord that would restore normalcy between the two countries. A healthy mutual disdain — and continued jockeying for control of the Eastern French countryside — sabotaged any progress that the politicians could produce. In the final weeks of September both sides returned home steeling for a fight: spurred on by some French slight, in response to a perceived German affront, over a disputed farmstead in Dijon. The German and French forces surrounding Paris both break camp and push towards the capital; the Germans putting up enough of an effort to prevent the French from re-fortifying a defensive posture.

The British, using the faltering talks in Brussels as justification, land their own “peace keeping” force in Belgium, while keeping Russian expansion at bay in the North of Norway — countering an advance just before the Winter freeze make the passage impossible.

The French in the South also find themselves soothing the very indignant Italian monarch — recalling their mistaken advance to Marseille but only as the Italians follow close behind.

In the Balkan states, Turkey digs in even under some pressure from the Austro-Hungarian contingency in Serbia. This distraction allows the Russian admirals to take hold of Rumania, locking in the spheres of influence in the East — and paving a path towards conflict in the vein of that which is engulfing the West.
