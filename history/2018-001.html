				1901 Spring

Surprisingly, Italy decided to make an immediate stab on their natural ally, Austria — moving immediately into Trieste (TRI). Austria, making a gambit to take the Balkan states, is caught completely by surprise, and the Italian army from Venice (VEN) waltzes in with no resistance at all.

Russia and Turkey stalemate as both fleets attempt to move into the Black Sea (BLA), but are otherwise unimpeded. Russia makes an aggressive move into Galicia (GAL), potentially opening up a northern front against an already crippled Austro-Hungarian effort.

France and Germany advance to their neighboring strongholds, uneventfully — though Germany notably leaves it's eastern edge undefended. Is there an understanding forged with the Russians already?

England takes to the sea, sending her fleets into the Scandinavian waters — no doubt looking for a foothold on the continent.
			</div>

			<div class="season">
				1901 Fall

Italy and Russia have seen an opportunity to collaborate, at the Italian occupation of Trieste (TRI) supports a second occupying Russian force moving into Budapest (BUD). Rather than fight to a stalemate, the Austrian continue their advance into Greece (GRE), and shore up their control of Vienna (VIE).

Russian influence continues to expand in the North, capturing Sweden (SWE) and advancing in Finland for a united Eastern Scandinavian expeditionary force.

England makes landfall by convoying her army in Yorkshire (YOR) into Norway (NOR), and swings around into the Barents Sea (BAR) looking to cause trouble for Russia.

Turkey, Germany(!), and France continue unopposed in their advance, capturing several Supply Centers apiece.
			</div>

			<div class="season">
				1902 Spring

				Seemingly sensing an opening, the Turks have now opened a third front in the ongoing, Austro-Italo-Russian conflict. Serbia falls to a joint offensive, ousting the Austrian Army into previously-occupied Greece.

Coordinated attacks into Vienna and Budapest between lingering Austro-Hungarian forces and a joint operation between Italy and Russia come to a stalemate.

A dispute over the Scandinavian peninsula also deadlocks with neither the English nor Russian forces making any gains.

Black Sea continues to remain unoccupied as forces attempting to advance there deadlock for the third time in a row.
			</div>

			<div class="season">
				1902 Fall

				The struggle for the Balkans continues. An Italian attempt to take the Austrian capital with Russian support was thwarted by a Turkish attack into occupied Hungary — backfiring spectacularly as the Austrians retake Trieste in an utter route of the Italian army.

The Turkish forces themselves wrapped up a relentless push into the Balkans as Austro-Hungarian forces retreat to protect the homeland.

Russian forces in Finland pushed the British army out of Norway; with nowhere to go, British troops took to the hills in disarray.

In further bad news for the British, French forces in Portugal made landfall in Wales, despite an attempt by the British navy to push France out of the English Channel. If the British had expected support from the German fleet, it did not materialize.

The German effort, satisfied with its gains in the previous year, largely remained at ease.

				1903 Spring — A Breakdown in Relations

				The constant stress of imminent continental war has fogged the minds of the European leaders.

A breakdown in communications in the multiple Austro-Hungarian fronts has left unit commanders in confusion; While the Austrian military geared up to support pushes into Budapest and Albania, these attacks never materialized — leaving the fleet anchored in Trieste surprised by a renewed Russo-Italian attack. A separate Turkish mobilization also deflated as the Russian commanders didn't push the attack.

The German forces in the West have risen from their slumber. Having seen their opening after years of apparent coordination, German forces quietly slipped into France and Italian provinces without finding any resistance.

France meanwhile presses an attack on England, who has in response withdrawn the Royal Navy into a defensive position.

Russian forces continue to parade about the countryside, raising the spirits of the commoners in impressive military displays.
			</div>

			<div class="season">
				1903 Fall — The Fall of Empires

				The concerted effort to deal a fatal blow to the Austro-Hungarian state has been realized as 1903 draws to a close. The merciless military might of the Eastern powers came to bear on the Dual Monarchy and as the Austrian capital in Vienna falls to the Russian advance, so does the crown.

In the West, another once-unassaiable empire is reminded of the precarious position of global powers in the modern era. Rather than retreat to confront the German offensive, the French naval officers have pressed their advantage in Britain to capture the seat of government in London; only conceding Liverpool to an British counterattack as half of the French navy charts a course back to the mainland.

Meanwhile, an Anglo-German offensive ejects the French from the English channel, but opens the opportunty for a French occupation of Belgium; which French forces are overjoyed in observing this as they roll across the border.

The collapse of the Austrian state has not slowed a Soutwestward advance — Turkey presses a (doomed) attack on Vienna, stalemated as the Turkish contingent in Albania is shelled by a nearby Italian flotila. An Italian retreat into Venice finds about as much luck, not able to muster enough power to keep the city on the water out of German hands.

Russian forces move en masse, crossing the German boarder in the East. Taking advantage of choas in Britain, Russian fleets take to the waters — the Norwegian army wades into the water but is generally confused by an order to support a fleet movement miles out in the ocean.

				1904 Spring — The Boiling Seas

				This Spring finds the armies of the continent merrily shuffling between various holdings; while the oceans roil with conflict.

The Italian admirals—seeing a Turkish armada poised to enter the Ionian Sea—have slipped behind the Turkish lines in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. Will this be enough of a bargaining chip to forestall Turkish expansion?

A similar plot in by the Germans to circle around the French ends in a stalemate in the Mid-Atlantic — the French expeditionary force swings back Southward confining the Germans to the English Channel. This prescience is not matched in the North Sea, where an eager attempt at a Franco-Russian collaboration to eject the Germans finds the French looking in vain for their counterparts. Nowhere nearby, the Russians successfully find a purchase for themselves on the English Island — ejecting the French from Edinburgh with help from the Germans!

A solitary English fleet, expecting doom and making a last ditch effort to reclaim Wales, somehow finds themselves unscathed within the maelstrom.

Russia and Turkey once again fail to resolve control of the Black Sea. Some sailors are wondering if they will ever get their promised furlough.

On the continent, the Germans have already abandoned their hold on Venice — allowing the Italian army to return and reconcile their position in the homeland. Turkey in turn moves into now unoccupied Trieste, staking a claim in the fallen Austrian coastline.

The second Reich continues their march Westward, striking the undefended Iberian peninsula. Meanwhile, Russian forces consolidate their hold of the south, along Germany's Eastern border.

				1904 Fall — The Deadly Feast

				As 1904 comes to a close, this great war—already having consuming consumed once-great Empires—has not lost its appetite.

Trieste again has changed hands, as Italian troops—invigorated by the easy liberation of Venice—have pressed back into Trieste, surprising a Turkish force that had looked to advance into Venice themselves. Unexpectedly: with the changing of the year, the Italians no longer find themselves surrounded by Germans, but by Russians.

In the East, Turkey has adeptly repelled the Italian marauders looking to sack Smyrna, while a second Turkish fleet offsets the capture of Trieste by making landfall in Naples.

Meanwhile, Russian forces have held Edinburgh after their surprise attack. While the Russian army in the North fortified the fleet in Liverpool, the French occupying force expected the admirals in Liverpool to assist in ousting the Russians — either by eagerness or unfamiliarity with the terrain not realizing this was an impossible maneuver.

In more bad news for the French, holdings in Belgium and Spain, as well as a tentative fortification in Holland, fell to the German juggernaut.

The Russian sailors in Sevastopol have apparently been granted collective furlough, as the fleet stationed there remained moored for the season — allowing the Turks a surprisingly quiet cruise into the Black Sea.

				1905 Spring — Rearranging the Deck Chairs

				Spring 1905 brings a long-sought calm to Europe — in large part, armies rebuild blasted fortifications and fleets return to ports to resupply.

Notably, the disarray of the French state leaves a vacuum all too eagerly filled by her neighbors — unsurprisingly the German and Russian forces make their way swiftly towards former French holdings.

In the South, valiant Italian forces hold strong in their dogged occupation of Trieste — though leaving the capital defenseless as the lone Turkish fleet meanders up the coast from Naples into Rome. Desperate to cause trouble for their aggressors, the expeditionary Italian fleet finds itself in far-flung Syria.
			</div>

			<div class="season">
				1905 Fall — The Enemy of my Enemy

				As Europe burns, alliances crumble.

In short — the German forces again find a sharp moment to turn against a neighbor. As Paris falls, the German army wastes no time in annexing Warsaw, threatening to split the Russian territories through the heart of Moscow.

At the same moment, Russia concludes one front and opens another. The opportunistic raid on England draws to a close — replacing the French in London and ousting the British navy from their final foothold in Liverpool. In the South, Rumania trades hands — what once seemed to be a no-man's-land is now sure to be the nexus of a new Russo-Turkish spat.

Trieste again falls in a final(?) join effort between Turkish and Russian forces, eroding the Italian defenses further. The Turks spend the autumn months in a siege against Rome, and as winter falls — so does the capital.
			</div>

			<div class="season">
				1906 Spring — Fortify the Homeland!

				After the Autumn attack and Winter thaw, Spring finds the European militaries looking to reconcile their positions.

The Russian admiralty attempts to set sail from conquered Britain, but only the fleet in Clyde manages to pull up anchor — they head into the Northern waters to take advantage of the warm weather. At the same time, the Russian army in the south successfully continues their push into the Balkan, wresting control of Bulgaria from the Turks, who can do little at the moment to stop the advance.

Turkish fleets also take to the water, with the occupying force in Naples getting a lift into Tunis. With the Italian naval threat mitigated, the army now behind the front have been freed up to confront the treacherous Russian stab — shoring up their defensive position in Serbia. A bold plan to bring an army into Sevastopol is thwarted by a Russian retreat, but effectively keeps the lone Russian fleet in the South locked away in Armenia.

My tactical mishap or miscommunication from central dispatch — the Italian army in Venice stands to an uncoordinated Turkish siege. The marauder fleet in Syria continues to apply pressure, but is rebuffed again.

Newly composed German forces waste no time in pushing into neighboring territories — though a chain of movements by Germany and Russia come to nothing at neither can claim definitive control of the crucial Galician province.
			</div>

			<div class="season">
				1906 Fall — Second Reich Rising

				As a seemingly unshakable military marches into European Russia, the rise of the German Empire nears a tipping point.

Russian forces, despite an attempt to push into Silesia — have been repulsed from Warsaw. In the south, the Russian front is recalled into a defensive stance in Ukraine and Sevastopol, though the phalanx stretching from Austria to Italy remains stranded as a movement into Galicia is countered again by a German snipper party.

In the South, a final attempt to stab into the Turkish homeland is resoundingly quashed — pushing the Russians no only out of their target in Constantinople, but out of their foothold in Bulgaria.

The Northern theater sees German forces making further advances into Russian occupied territories — as Russian forces flee the British Isle, armies of the Reich eagerly position their ranks to replace them. In a bold stab, the German generals abandon their potential claim in Norway to strike deep into an undefended St. Petersburg.

Finally, the Italians, resigned to their fate, succeed in maintaining their position by doing nothing.
			</div>

			<div class="season">
				1907 Spring — Deadlock

				A great stalemate has emerged on the continent — the war effort of the remaining powers was largely stymied this Spring.

The German advance to the East was held back by the defensive maneuvers of Russian generals — though Turkey used this moment of distraction to finally assault Sevastopol.

Perhaps looking to seal the fate of the Italians, the Russian forces in Vienna stood ready to greet the latest wave of Turkish attacks into Venice — but the Turks instead stood their ground.

In Britain, German forces finally oust the blockaded fleet in London, while a parallel attack into Liverpool looks to seize control of that coastal stronghold.
			</div>

			<div class="season">
				1907 Fall — The German Empire Victorious

				The German war machine — however duplicitous it representatives — is proven effectively unstoppable.

As Britain quickly falls to their third occupying force in so many years — so too the once dominant Russian tsarist government. Moscow, the last stronghold, is too tempting a target for the remaining powers. Despite a retreating Russian army, and a separate Turkish assault from the South, Moscow is successfully seized by the Germans in a coordinated flanking attack.

Russian counter-attacks elsewhere fail to find any purchase: an attack on German-held Sweden is stalled by Danish reinforcements; an attempt to retake Sevastopol find it's support cut off at the knees; and an attack on Munich falters waiting for reinforcements from all-too-distant Vienna.

Now controlling more than half of the supply centers, the German Empire has forced the other powers of Europe to sue for peace and begin to confront their new post-war political reality.

German victory.
