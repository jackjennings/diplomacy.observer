			Diplomacy Observer is an informal, amateur Diplomacy group.

			Diplomacy is a game of negotiation and deception, set in early-20th century Europe. Each player commands one of seven great powers, building and breaking alliances to gain military control of the continent. The game mechanics of Diplomacy are simple; but the so-called "game to end friendships" has a freeform and complex metagame that will make each player doubt how well that know their closest accomplices.

			   ***

			Games are coordinated online, using <a href="https://fourteenpointslounge.slack.com">Slack</a> as a primary communication channel, and <a href="https://www.backstabbr.com">Backstabbr</a> to track game state.

			All games follow a schedule of two turns per week, with orders adjudicated on Monday and Thursday. Orders must be submitted on Slack by midnight PT the day prior to adjudication.

			A deposit of 20 USD is required to hold a place in a game. Deposits should be sent via Venmo (@jackjennings) or <a href="https://paypal.me/diplomacyobserver">PayPal</a> along with the game number listed below. An invitation to the Slack team will be provided after posting your deposit. Deposits for each game will be donated to the charity of the winner's choosing.

			You may also sign up to be an understudy, replacing any players who drop out of a game. Deposits are waived for understudies, but you must be ready to fill in on short notice. Contact the GM for more details.

			New players must attend a livestream to explain how unit movement works, and how to issue orders. This orientation includes a short practice game (4-6 turns) without any negotiations (to practice issuing orders). Expect the livestream to last about an hour and a half.
